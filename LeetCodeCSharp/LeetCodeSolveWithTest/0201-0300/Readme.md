# 208. [Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)](https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-trie-prefix-tree)

## Intuition

The Trie (Prefix Tree) data structure is well-suited for efficiently storing and searching words, particularly when we need to check if words or prefixes exist. Given that each node can have 26 children (for each letter of the alphabet), we can traverse the Trie as we insert or search for words. Each node represents a character, and the traversal is based on the characters in the word.

## Approach

1. **TrieNode Structure**: Each `TrieNode` holds an array `Child` of size 26 to represent the possible children nodes (one for each lowercase letter) and a boolean `WordEnd` to mark if a word ends at that node.
2. **Insert**: To insert a word, we traverse the Trie starting from the root. For each character in the word, we compute its index (using the difference between the character and 'a'), and if the corresponding child is null, we create a new node. At the end of the word, we mark the `WordEnd` flag as true.
3. **Search**: To search for a word, we follow the same traversal as the insert operation. If at any point a characterâ€™s corresponding child is null, the word doesn't exist. If we reach the end of the word and the `WordEnd` flag is true, the word exists in the Trie.
4. **StartsWith**: Similar to the search, but we only check if the prefix exists by traversing the Trie. There's no need to check for the `WordEnd` flag.

```csharp
public class TrieNode
{
    public TrieNode?[] Child;
    public bool WordEnd;
    public TrieNode()
    {
        Child = new TrieNode?[26];
        WordEnd = false;
    }
}

public class Trie {

    private TrieNode root;
    public Trie()
    {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }

    public void Insert(string word)
    {
        var current = root;

        foreach (char ch in word)
        {
            var index = ch - 'a';
            if (current.Child[index] == null)
            {
                current.Child[index] = new TrieNode();
            }

            current = current.Child[index];
        }

        current.WordEnd = true;
    }

    public bool Search(string word)
    {
        var current = root;

        foreach (char ch in word)
        {
            var index = ch - 'a';

            if (current.Child[index] == null)
                return false;

            current = current.Child[index];
        }

        return current.WordEnd;
    }

    public bool StartsWith(string prefix)
    {
        var current = root;

        foreach (char ch in prefix)
        {
            var index = ch - 'a';

            if (current.Child[index] == null)
                return false;

            current = current.Child[index];
        }

        return true;
    }
}

```

## Complexity Analysis

- Time complexity:
  - **Insert**: For each word, we process each character once. Thus, the time complexity is $O(m)$, where $m$ is the length of the word.
  - **Search**: Similar to insert, the time complexity is $O(m)$ for a word of length $m$.
  - **StartsWith**: This also requires processing each character of the prefix, so the time complexity is $O(m)$ for a prefix of length $m$.

- Space complexity:
  - **Insert**: In the worst case, each node in the Trie can have up to 26 children. The space complexity depends on the total number of characters inserted, so it is $O(n \times m)$, where $n$ is the number of words, and $m$ is the average length of the words.
  - **Search** and **StartsWith** don't use additional space aside from the Trie, so their space complexity is $O(1)$.
